# Music-Genre-Classification
Music being a significant art form is listened by millions every day. Due to the vast accessibility
of high bandwidth internet, various digital music streaming platforms are popular currently. These
music platforms contain millions of song databases, thousands of different types of songs and music
is released every year. The classification of music based on genres is an important objective for
music enthusiasts and especially for online streaming platforms. The classification helps to organise
music in a more subtle way, and could provide recommendations to the users on the basis of their
preferences. To model this problem through AI, a deep neural network will be used. Furthermore,
the network will be based on models which can accommodate sequential data. Based on our initial
understanding we suggest a long short term memory (LSTM) to classify different genres obtained
from GTZAN data set. The procedure for solving the problem will be to initially visualize and
pre-process the dataset. Afterwards LSTM model will be applied, training data and validation data
will be evaluated at the end. The pre-processing was performed on raw audio files by extracting
MFCCs and the model was trained on these features, and also directly on raw data.
